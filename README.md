# Oxide: CKA Preparation Project

## Overview

"Oxide" is now a hands-on project designed to help you prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. This project provides a real-world environment where you can practice CKA-related concepts and develop practical skills using Kubernetes. While this is a personal project, it is also a guided learning tool, and the goal is to provide an environment where you can learn and practice the fundamentals needed for CKA certification.

## Key Goals

*   Gain practical experience with Kubernetes concepts, configurations, and operations.
*   Master key topics required for the CKA exam.
*   Build a hands-on environment for testing and experimentation.
*   Provide a guided learning path to cover the main areas covered by the CKA curriculum.
*   Apply your learning to a real project and see immediate results

## CKA Curriculum Alignment

This project is structured to align with the key areas of the CKA exam:

*   **Core Concepts:** Pods, Deployments, Services, Namespaces.
*   **Networking:** CNI, Network Policies, Ingress.
*   **Storage:** Volumes, Persistent Volumes, Storage Classes.
*   **Security:** RBAC, Secrets, Security Contexts.
*   **Scheduling:** Node Selectors, Affinity, Taints and Tolerations.
*   **Cluster Maintenance:** Upgrades, Backups, Monitoring.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Debugging pods, analyzing logs.
*   **Configuration:** ConfigMaps, Environment Variables.

## Technologies

*   **Containerization:** Docker or Orbstack (as a container runtime).
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (using MicroK8s, K3s, or Minikube).
*   **Programming Language:** Rust (for building tooling and services - optional).

## Project Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Install Docker or Orbstack.
    *   Install `kubectl` for Kubernetes interaction.
    *   Install the Rust toolchain (optional, if you plan to write tooling or services in Rust).

2.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
    *   Navigate to the project directory: `cd oxide`

3. **Getting Started with CKA Tasks**
    *  Follow the tasks in the project board.
    * Each task will help you to understand and apply a core concept that will be tested on the CKA exam.

## Development Workflow

The project workflow is driven by CKA related topics and tasks:

1.  **CKA Topic Selection:** We will start by selecting a CKA related topic.
2.  **Hands-On Tasks:** We will develop a set of hands-on tasks tied to that topic.
3.  **Study and Practice:** You will study the CKA concept and implement the tasks in the project.
4.  **Experiment and Review:** You can experiment with different approaches, and have your code reviewed to ensure your understanding.

## Task Management

*   This project uses GitHub Projects for task management.
*   Each task is tracked using GitHub Issues.
